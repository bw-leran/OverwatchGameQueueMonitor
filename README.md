# OverwatchGameQueueMonitor
Utilizes computer vision to monitor computer screen, detecting and sending an email notification once an online match has been found, then automatically selects the userâ€™s preferred character. 

## How to Use?
In Overwatch, there are multiple heroes you can choose from. So the program will first prompt you to enter the hero you would like to play as. It will then monitor your screen and wait for you to connect to an online match... This can sometimes take 15 minutes! So go relax, go sit on the couch, because the program will send you an email notification once you have found a match, and will have already selected the hero you wanted.
